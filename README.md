# Context
Context is an annotation service to take content from the web and add annotations . [This](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/context) is the main entry point for the project with a detailed tutorial on both the server and web client. 

## Server
[The server](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/context-server) at this time is currently hosted on Heroku. I used CircleCI for continuous integration testing.  The database for the data layer is hosted on mLab.

## Webclient 
[The webclient](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/context-webclient) uses React, redux, director, end-to-end testing via Nightwatch.js and Selenium, and a few other foundational technologies.
